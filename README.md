# Read Me -  GIZ  Android App "Siegelklarheit" #

**Master** is the current **stable branch** - development work should be done in personal branches and then merge requested.

I'm using Android Studio (0.8 Beta), which uses [gradle](http://www.gradle.org/), but this is **not** a requirement/dependency - everything can be compiled from the command line if necessary.

I'm developing for Android version 4.0.3 (aka Ice Cream Sandwich), which is API level 15 - this means we support 90% of devices (as of [November 2014](https://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/index.html) ).

Build is against SDK API 21 (Android 5).
